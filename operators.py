# Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical variables such as int or float. See the table for the common arithmetic operators used in Python:

# Operator	Name of Operation    Example   	Description
# +	        Addition	         x + y   	x plus y
# -     	Subtraction	         x - y	    x minus y
# *     	Multiplication	     x * y	    x multiplied by y
# **	    Exponentiation     	 x ** y 	x raised to the power of y
# /	        Division	         x / y	    x divided by y
# //	    Floor Division	     x // y	    x divided by y, returning integer
# %	        Modulo	             x % y	    The remainder of x divided by y


# Assignment Operators
# There are two types of assignment operators: the assignment operator and compound assignment operators. 
# The assignment operator, =, is used to assign values to variables.
# Compound assignment operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on a variable and reassign its value at the same time. 
# Here are the common assignment operators:

# Operator	    Example	    Description
# =	            x = 4	    Assign 4 to x
# +=	        x += 4	    Add 4 to existing value of x
# -=	        x -= 4	    Subtract 4 from existing value of x
# *=	        x *= 4	    Multiply existing value by 4
# /=	        x /= 4	    Divide existing value by 4
# %=	        x %= 4	    Modulo existing value by 4


# Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare two variables. The result from these operators is a bool (True or False). Here are the comparison operators:

# Operator	    Description	                 Example
# ==	        Equal to	                 x == y
# !=	        Not equal to	             x != y
# >	            Greater than	             x > y
# <	            Less than	                 x < y
# >=	        Greater than or equal to 	 x >= y
# <=	        Less than or equal to	     x <= y


# Logical operators are used to combine and evaluate multiple conditions. 
# The result is a bool (True or False).

#   Operator	Description	                                        Example
#   and	        If both statements are true, returns True	        x > 2 and y > 1
#   or	        If one of the statements are true, returns True	    x > 3 or y > 5
#   not	        If used, returns the reverse of the actual result	not(x > 10 and y > 5)
